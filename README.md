## Game Description

Whack-a-Cat is a fast-paced browser game inspired by the classic "Whac-A-Mole" arcade game but with a space twist! Players must click on cats as they appear to score points while avoiding sneaky dogs that freeze the game and reduce your life points. The goal is to reach 18 hits before time runs out.

I created this game to improve my JavaScript skills and challenge myself with DOM manipulation, timers, event handling, and custom styling. The space theme and characters were added to enhance the experience and make it more fun and visually engaging.
